This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=119

This script is for those of us who uses embedded scripting language in the here document form.
see :help perl, :help ruby, :help python, :help tcl
if you embed a script in vim using the 
perl<<EOF
#some perl code
EOF
or equivalent for other script languages, the scripts won't be correctly indented.
Worse, if you write some python this way and reindent your file the whole script is trashed since
the indentation was meaningfull and it is lost.

This scripts add support for indenting the embedded script.
Please mail me any problems you encounter with this script
